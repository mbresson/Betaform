Betaform
========

Synopsis
--------

Betaform is a platform game which takes place in 2115. You are a robot and you can move, jump, and shoot, but your autonomy is limited: whenever you do something, your battery is drained. If you run out of power, jumping and shooting become impossible (till you get some power back).

Betaform is a school project. It is developed in Java and uses the powerful libGDX. It should run fine on any OS supported by those. The source code is quite ugly and I am not satisfied with it: since it was my first time trying to write a complete game and because of the close deadline, I didn't think long enough before developing it. Nonetheless, I learned a lot in the process. For now, the game kind of works, and the level editor is half done. There are three levels for you to try.

I did all the graphics myself, with the help of Inkscape, a free and open source vector graphics software. Since I'm a developer, not a graphist, the graphics just suck but I can live with it since it was not the purpose of the project and most other students used resources from the Internet.
